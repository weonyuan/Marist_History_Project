    				<p>Leonidoff Field is Marist's first major athletic field, providing a venue for sports and intermural activities hosted by the Marist Athletics Department. It is also home to Tenney Stadium, which offers seating for over 5,000 spectators.</p>
    				<p>The field was dedicated to Dr. Aleski A. Leonidoff in 1968. Leonidoff was born and raised in Russia, and developed a relationship with Marist through Jack Gartland. During his tenure as a physician at St. Francis Hospital, he donated money to the College for the construction of the field. In addition, he donated funds to support a scholarship for students specializing in science and pre-medical studies.</p>
			  		<p>Since its beginnings in 1965, multiple improvements have been made to the field. An irrigation system consisting of 11 zones and 36 sprinkler heads was installed to keep the then-Kentucky bluegrass, fescue, and rye natural turf looking its best. In 2001 Musco field lighting was installed to allow night games to occur, opening up a new range of possibilities for the field.</p>
			  		<p>Marist Football has since been the program that has seen the most activity on the field, but other teams use it regularly, such as soccer, lacrosse, and intermural sports.</p>
