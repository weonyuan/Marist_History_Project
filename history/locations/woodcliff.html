    				<p style="-webkit-margin-before: 0em;">The Woodcliff Pleasure Park, open from 1927 to 1941, was a well-known amusement park along the Hudson River. It was located where Gartland Apartments and the Gartland Atheltic Field stand today.</p>
    				<p>The riverfront property has passed through many hands, starting with Jack Flack Winslow. Mr. Winslow owned, alongside Erastus Corning, the Rensselaer Iron Works and Albany Iron Works - the most prominent iron works in the nation. He and his second wife, Harriet Wickes, moved to the Wood Cliff estate in 1868. There was one main house along with three summer houses called Crag, Cliff, and Lookout. Winding paths, foot bridges, a farm, a greenhouse, and a small stream created a serene setting that was renowned throughout the banks of the Hudson. After Winslow and Harriett passed away, the estate was sold to John B. Marian and his wife, Elizabeth. The Marians planned to uphold the beloved estate, but sold Wood Cliff to Fred Ponty who turned the property into an amusement park, or pleasure park as they were known at the time.</p>
			  		<p>Ponty received the property with all the existing structures on April 18, 1927. It was ideal space due to the closeness of the Hudson River which provided access to day liners from New York City. Day liners could transport as many as 18,000 day trippers in addition to a trolley service that transported local Poughkeepsie citizens to the park. It is believed the park opened on a limited basis in 1927 and gained full operation the following year.</p>
			  		<p>Woodcliff Pleasure Park was completed in one year. Costing over $1,000,000, it covered 27 acres and featured a variety of attractions able to please any thrill-seeker. The mansion was converted into an inn with a restaurant, dance hall, and a bar. The gatehouses were transformed into entrance point. The stables and stableman's house were torn down and a notable pink ticket house was added. The park developed many feature entertainment venues. This included bumper cars, pony rides, carousels, a tunnel of love, Ferris wheels, arcades, a giant airplane swing, midway games, shoot-the-chutes, shooting, galleries, whips, lake boat rides, and a low coaster called The Caterpillar. Other entertainment attractions incorporated wrestling, boxing matches, a roller skating rink, a Tom Thumb golf course, equestrian events, baseball games, and an occasional fireworks show. Visitors could walk around in gardens (which were illuminated at night) and have picnic lunches. Special talents and acts also visited the park, the most notable being The Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus.</p>
			  		<p>Despite all the quality entertainment, the main attractions were the pool and The Blue Streak roller coaster. The Blue Streak was built by Joseph McKee. He followed the designs created by engineer Vernon Keenan, who built the famous Cyclone of Coney Island. The two roller coasters were very similar in that they were both "out and back" coaster (the end was also the start), both constructed with wood, and chain pulled.</p>
			  		<p>The Blue Streak is estimated at 120 feet to 140 feet high and 2,000 to 3,200 feet in length. At the time, it was the highest roller coaster in the world and remained so until the "coaster wars" of the 1970's. The Blue Streak also held the speed record for 54 years, at 65.2 miles per hour until 1981. These records made Blue Streak a legend in amusement park history.</p>
			  		<p>The pool at Woodcliff Pleasure Park cost around $90,000 and was able to hold 3,000 swimmers, with the estimated pool measurements being around 50 by 200 feet. The park's pool may have been an extension of an original pool constructed by the Winslow's around 1918. The pool had a modern filtration system, which was highly bragged about, and bathhouses were added in 1930. The Woodcliff Pleasure Park Pool was noted as one of the largest pools on the East Coast, and probably one of the biggest in the country.</p>
			  		<p>Unfortunately, the success at Woodcliff Pleasure Park was short-lived.  At the turn of the decade the Stock Market Crash heavily influenced the steady decline of Woodcliff Pleasure Park, along with many other amusement parks. Although the Hudson River Day Line brought thousands of visitors, certain events tarnished the park's reputation. In July of 1914, a group of African Americans were denied right to swim in the pool. Outraged, they retaliated by throwing rocks around the pool. Later that summer 3,000 day liners arrived and when the visitors were denied beer, they smashed windows, mirrors, destroyed furniture, and threw rocks and bottles which resulted in injuring a child. Knives, and even a hatchet, were involved. The New York State Police were called to control this riot, but could not help. The damage extended to four automobiles and several buildings. The park closed in August 1941, a few weeks after Fred Ponty died.</p>
			  		<p>The rides were dismantled after the park closed. The historic Blue Streak's steel parts were given to the WWII war effort and the wood was used by the Marist Brothers to build a beehive. Only the picnic area, gatehouses, main house, barn, outhouse, and pool were left. Many different groups, such as the City of Poughkeepsie and the Polish American Club, fought over ownership of the park. Eventually a construction company used the area to store heavy equipment. By this time only the building with the billiards room remained.</p>
			  		<p style="-webkit-margin-after: 0em;">Marist College bought the property around 1983. The College built student apartments on the land and later created an athletic field. To put the park in perspective of today, the Blue Streak stood on the softball diamond, the pool on the soccer field, and the pink ticket house east of the Blue Streak on Route 9.</p>
