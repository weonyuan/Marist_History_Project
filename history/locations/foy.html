    				<p style="-webkit-margin-before: 0em;">Foy Townhouses, built in 1982, currently serve as sophomore housing towards the north end of campus.  This 210-student housing complex is divided into seven three-story town houses with space for ten students in each house. The main floor consists of a kitchen, a large common room, and a terrace that overlooks the Hudson River. Upstairs there are three bedrooms and two bathrooms, while the lowest level has a small common room, one bathroom and two bedrooms. Each bedroom is assigned to two students.</p>
			  		<p style="-webkit-margin-after: 0em;">In 2003 these townhouses were named in honor of President Emeritus and Life Trustee, Dr. Linus Richard Foy. He was named President of Marist College in 1958 and, at age 28, became the youngest college president in the United States. Dr. Foy made countless contributions to the development of the College until 1979, when Marist's current President, Dennis J. Murray was appointed.</p>
