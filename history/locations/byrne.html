    				<p>The Byrne House was built during the expansion of Marist College in 1963 to house the Dominicas Fathers who were, at that time, college chaplains. After fulfilling its use, and a few renovations later, in 1985 the house became the new location of the Counseling Center and Health Services to serve as a Personal Development Center. Combining these services allowed students to come together in one space, making it more convenient and worthwhile to visit.</p>
			  		<p>More recently, Health Services moved back into the Student Center and Byrne has been established as the school ministry and permanent residence of the Counseling Center.</p>
			  		<p>The house was named after Brother George Francis Byrne. Originally from Western, New York, Brother Byrne came to Marist in 1949 to teach History. He became a Marist Brother on July 26, 1926 and served until his death on October 25, 1953. He was buried in the Marist Brother's cemetery.</p>
