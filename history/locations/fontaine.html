    				<p>The original Fontaine Hall was constructed by the Marist Brothers in 1956 under the supervision of Brother Nilus Donnelly. He supervised Marist Brothers volunteers who worked on building the college during the summer months. Student brothers also worked on the project during the spring and fall semesters, which were lengthened by two weeks to allow small teams to help Brother Nilus year-round. The estimated cost to build the structure was $828,895, but it was built for $350,000 due to the hard work of the Brothers.</p>
    				<p>During a blistering summer day, the brothers were hard at work constructing Fontaine Hall. Two groups of student brothers were applying perma-stone to opposite sides of the building. A hose used to wet the cement was accidentally held so the water arched over the roof, sprinkling the other group of brothers. Declarations of war were issued and both armies met on the roof of Fontaine, buckets of water and hoses at the ready. Twenty minutes later the war was over and both sides returned to work, happy in victory, cool and refreshed. </p>
			  		<p>After the building was completed it was named after Brother Paul Ambrose Fontaine, President Emeritus and Life Trustee of Marist College. He played a major role in shaping Marist from a two year junior college to a four year liberal arts college.</p>
			  		<p>As Marist expanded, Fontaine Hall's functions varied to suit the needs of the students.</p>
			  		<p>Fontaine Hall was originally attached to the chapel by a passageway. The architecture mirrored that of the chapel, with long laminated beams radiating out from a single pillar to support the wooden roof. An award-winning curtain of glass gave way to a beautiful panoramic view of the Hudson River.</p>
			  		<p>The main floor of Fontaine housed a circular study hall with an open space in the center. On the north side was "Our Lady's Library" which held books relating to the Blessed Virgin. It was organized by Brother Cyril Robert, the college librarian and merged with the main collection when the library moved from Donnelly to Fontaine. The northwest corner of the building contained a visitor's suite, dining room, bedroom, and balcony. It was a popular spot to hold group meetings.</p>
			  		<p>The lower floor contained a kitchen and dining room which served as the school's cafeteria and provided meals to the faculty and 120 student brothers. A unique crucifix dominated the staircase connecting the study hall to the dining room. Instead of nails going through the palms, the figure of Christ had nails going through His wrists. This scientifically correct approach reflected the Marist Brothers' scholasticism and search for the truth.</p>
			  		<p>In 1958, a four-story addition was attached to Fontaine because St. Ann's hermitage was deemed unsafe. The steel frame addition became the new dormitory for the student brothers. In 1974, when the Benoit and Gregory houses were built, the addition was modified to accommodate the offices of the Humanities Department. Later, it housed the Learning Resources Center, which included the library, learning center, and an audiovisual and television facility.</p>
			  		<p>Eventually, in 1997, Fontaine Hall had to be demolished to make way for the construction of the James A. Cannavino Library.</p>
			  		<p>Fontaine was rebuilt in 2000 as the home of the School of Liberal Arts. It houses multimedia classrooms, a black box theatre, and the Office of College Advancement, including the offices of Alumni Relations and Public Affairs. It also features the Henry Hudson room, a large conference room that offers stunning views of the Hudson River. Up until recently it also contained the MIPO, the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. The hallway on the first floor, also known as the Gallery Corridor, is lined with photographs of Franklin D. Roosevelt to remind the Marist community of the close affiliation between the College and the FDR Presidential Library in the neighboring town of Hyde Park.</p>
