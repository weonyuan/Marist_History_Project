    				<p style="-webkit-margin-before: 0em;">In 1894 representatives from Columbia University, Cornell University, and the University of Pennsylvania selected the Hudson River at Poughkeepsie as the site for regattas of their newly formed Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA). The first Poughkeepsie Regatta was held in June of 1895 and attracted more than 30,000 spectators. The challenging four-mile course ran south from Crum Elbow (near Hyde Park) to just south of the current site of the Mid-Hudson Bridge.</p>
    				<p>Poughkeepsie soon became known as the “Rowing Capital of the World,” hosting IRA regattas from 1895-1949. In addition to the founding members, participants over the years included California, Georgetown, Harvard, MIT, Navy, Princeton, Rutgers, Stanford, Syracuse, Washington, Wisconsin and Yale. In 1949, the IRA moved its annual regatta briefly to Ohio, and then to Onondaga Lake near Syracuse.</p>
			  		<p>Marist acquired the historic Cornell boathouse from the university of which it is named in 1977, as part a deal with the City of Poughkeepsie. This would enable local high school rowing programs to have access to the facility. This stipulation remained in effect until 2002. A five-year restoration began in 2004. The process began with the addition of windows and replacing outer shingles. During the process, workers tore down inner walls, installed insulation, replaced the deck, repainted the ceiling beams, and added an elevator.</p>
			  		<p style="-webkit-margin-after: 0em;">When completed in 2009, Marist's historic Cornell Boathouse stands two-stories tall and remains as a functional boathouse on the first floor, while the second level plays host to a wide variety of campus events. The boathouse has a number of original features despite the remodeling. There is a plaque commemorating the dedication of the structure that hangs above a refurbished gas fireplace. Also, the second floor is decorated with wooden beams overhead, which provided the original structure to the boathouse in the 19th century.</p>
