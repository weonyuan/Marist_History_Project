    				<p>Donnelly Hall is names after Brother Nilus Donnelly, a physics professor at the time, who impacted the development of Marist College both physically and academically. Donnelly Hall was finally finished in 1962 after three long summers of hard work by schoolteachers who were untrained in construction work. Some obstacles the dedicated Marist Brothers overcame was the discovery of water seepage from an underground stream into the foundation holes. The water had to be pumped out and directed away from the worksite. Brother Nilus directed all the work and operated the heavy machinery.</p>
    				<p>Donnelly Hall has served as headquarters for almost every college activity on campus in addition to academics and even a residence hall for lay students even though it was originally built to hold dorm rooms, cafeteria, bookstore, lecture halls, classrooms, and a library. Donnelly is currently home to the School of Science, science labs, the Fashion Program, photography darkrooms, lecture halls, classrooms, Security, Registrar, Financial Aid, Information Technology, Human Resources, the computer store, the Copy Center, and even a coffee shop.</p>
