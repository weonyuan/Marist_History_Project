    				<p>The Student Center is the most recognized building on the Marist campus. It brings the Marist community together in one central space for activities, dining, and the chance to form new relationships.</p>
    				<p>The Campus Center was completed in 1965, with 66,000 square feet comprising of the Browsing Library, Gallery Lounge, and Fireside Lounge. It was originally a part of Champagnat Hall, but the building eventually separated into two distinct facilities.</p>
    				<p>Plans for the new Student Center were included in the college's "Vision '94" campaign, which was completed in 1995. This $27 million campaign sought to renovate the old Campus Center by adding new facilities and updating those already existing. Funding for this project came from the sale of construction bonds through the New York State Dormitory Authority. Additional funds were provided by tuition, fees, and the release of the Canterbury apartments Marist students used in the past.</p>
			  		<p>As one of the largest construction jobs in Marist history, this campaign created the Rotunda, Cabaret, and Mid-Rise, adding an additional 63,000 square feet to the building. Renovations were made to the bookstore, dining facilities, performing arts center, and the campus green. A breezeway was installed between Champagnat and the Student Center to connect the two buildings. New offices and club rooms were created for the Student Government Association, The Circle, Health Services, and Student Activities. Three alcoves were installed for students as a place for meeting up and studying between classes. A new dining facility, the Cabaret, was constructed with a large area for performances, lectures, special events, and student activities. An adjoining Commuter Lounge became a place for off-campus students to do homework or relax with friends.</p>
			  		<p>Presently, the Student Center is, once again, under major construction to attach a multipurpose academic building. Renovations are being made to enhance the building for everyone. Specifically, improvements are being made to the Performing Arts Room, Student Government Association Office, and Nelly Goletti Theatre. A new music wing is being constructed to house the Marist Band, Singers, and Orchestra and will include rehearsal halls, practice rooms, music labs, classrooms, and faculty offices.  The dining hall will be completely transformed into a grander space with vaulted ceilings and increased seating capacity.  Efforts are being made to make the new building more environmentally friendly by making improvements to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning.</p>
